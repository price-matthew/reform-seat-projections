# reform-seat-projections
This code estimates how many seats Reform UK could win in a general election based on uniform swing, and plots the result. 

The model is crude and the code is correspondingly simple. The only complexity comes from the need to account for situations where the vote share of Labour and/or the Conservatives in a constituency is so small that the swing to Reform would result in a negative vote share for one or both of the other parties.
